This Bash script facilitates user and group management on Linux systems. It prompts users to input their username and a strong password, creates the user, adds them to a specified group, and provides options for user confirmation.

## Example
```bash
$ ./script.sh
Enter your name as user: JohnDoe
Creating with name: JohnDoe
Enter your password (8 characters at least):
Your password is strong! Nice work.
Enter the default group name: developers
Do you want to create the user? y/n: y
User created
